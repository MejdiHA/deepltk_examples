# Single Output Logistic Regression


#### Detailed articles on this and similar projects can be found on Ngene's [Website](https://www.ngene.co/blog) <br/> The blog posts guides on developing Deep Neural Networks to solve problems, ranging from basic to advanced, using the [DeepLTK](https://www.ngene.co/deep-learning-toolkit-for-labview) toolkit.

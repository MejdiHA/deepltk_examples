# Single Output Logistic Regression


#### Detailed articles on this and similar projects can be found on Ngene's [Website](https://www.ngene.co/blog) <br/> The blog posts guides on developing Deep Neural Networks to solve problems, ranging from basic to advanced, using the [DeepLTK](https://www.ngene.co/deep-learning-toolkit-for-labview) toolkit.

In this example, we will explore how Deep Neural Networks can be employed to model the logical AND operator.
<br/>
It combines two Boolean values and returns true(1) if both of the values are true . If either of the values is false(0) , the operator returns false.
